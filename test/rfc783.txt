 The protocol was originally designed by Noel Chiappa, and was
redesigned by him, Bob Baldwin and Dave Clark, with comments from Steve
Szymanski. The current revision of the document includes modifications
stemming from discussions with and suggestions from Larry Allen, Noel
Chiappa, Dave Clark, Geoff Cooper, Mike Greenwald, Liza Martin, David
Reed, Craig Milo Rogers (of UCS-ISI), Kathy Yellick, and the author.
The acknowledgement and retransmission scheme was inspired by TCP, and
the error mechanism was suggested by PARC's EFTP abort message.
